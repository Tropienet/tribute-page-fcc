        <h2 class="section-title">Early Life</h2>
        <p class="section-info">
            Charles Robert Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family's home, The Mount.<br>
            He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier Robert Darwin and Susannah Darwin (née Wedgwood). <br>
            His grandfathers Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood were both prominent abolitionists. Erasmus Darwin had praised general<br> concepts of evolution and common descent in his Zoonomia (1794), 
            a poetic fantasy of gradual creation including undeveloped ideas anticipating concepts his grandson expanded.

        <h2 class="section-title">Survey voyage on HMS Beagle</h2>
        <p class="section-info">
            After leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a few days with student friends at Barmouth.<br>
             He returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished)
             <br> naturalist for a self-funded supernumerary place on HMS Beagle with captain Robert FitzRoy,
             <br> a position for a gentleman rather than "a mere collector". The ship was to leave in four weeks
             <br> on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America. Robert Darwin objected to his son's planned
             <br> two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, Josiah Wedgwood II, to agree to (and fund) his son's participation.
             <br> Darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection,<br> 
            intending it for a major scientific institution.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Inception of Darwin's evolutionary theory</h2>
        <p class="section-info">
            On 2 October 1836 Beagle anchored at Falmouth, Cornwall. Darwin promptly made the long coach
            <br> journey to Shrewsbury to visit his home and see relatives. He then hurried to Cambridge to see Henslow,
            <br> who advised him on finding available naturalists to catalogue Darwin's animal collections and to take on
            <br> the botanical specimens. Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded gentleman scientist,
            <br> and an excited Darwin went round the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections.
            <br> British zoologists at the time had a huge backlog of work, due to natural history collecting being encouraged throughout the British Empire,
            <br> and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.
